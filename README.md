# Paper Air plane launcher
This was a relatively complex project that aimed to launch a paper air plane with a geared robotic arm.
## Planing
There was a thorough and set out plan which included drawings and a schedule.  this plan was used as a basis for all the work for the project and the drawings were fundamental to the creation of the onshape model. These drawings were made in Ms paint as a quick reference tool for when the CAD work needed to be completed. It was also used to explain our project to Mister H and to make a proof of concept that would help validate the initial idea.


### Here are some inital drawings

These were the initial drawings made in MS Paint they were used as reference points for onshape and Design and were overall simple summaries of the project. I do this for every project so I know what needs doing and what has been completed by referencing the image.

This this the drawing for the paper air plane holder wich was worked by pushing a servo with a pad into a upright push pad wich would clamp it down.

### Schedule

Their where manny diffrent issues with this project that dident allow it to be completed this will be revewed in the reflection.
## Cad
The cad was realtivly difucult creating 1 part that could hold 3 gears and the top of the box together. The Complicated and compact part that would hurt the consturction process later. 
### Gears

The gears where by far the most complicated part of the design process. It included two nut traps 3 interchanging gears a 1 arm mount. It was also heavly intagrated meaning allmost all of the moving parts interacted with one part. Later on I would find out this was a mistake as a reprint or repair would require total disasembily. In onshape I had the most difucuty creating the nut traps as I used a nut in the assembily context as refrance. When I finished this nut trap I constrained the part with a revolute mate, but when I updated the context the refrence nut had rotated runining my nut trap. I fixed this by un contexting the nut and fixing the rlative skech variables.

The nut trap was needed to connect the paralell gear and make sure that they where spining in unison not figting against eachother.

Overall I should have scrapped most of the design but becasue I had became too invested in this design I had not scrapped it.

This is a wiering digram of what the wiering of the final circut would have looked like

The code was verry limited and required and was verry bare bones.
## Reflection
This project had many diffrent issues from the begining i lacked motivation and excitemnt I usaly have for projects stifilig my creative cading abilities that usaly make great designs.
