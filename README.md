# Paper Air plane launcher
This was a relatively complex project that aimed to launch a paper air plane with a geared robotic arm.
## Planing
Most of the planing was done with a google doc and MS paint and there was a rough schedule set out. For allmost all my projects I make inital blueprints in MS paint that serve as a basis for my 
### Here are some inital drawings

## Cad
The cad was realtivly difucult creating 1 part that could hold 3 gears and the top of the box together. Complicated and compact that would hurt the consturction process later. 
### Gears

The gears where by far the most complicated part of the design process. It included two nut traps 3 interchanging gears a 1 arm mount. It was also heavly intagrated meaning allmost all of the moving parts interacted with one part. Later on I would find out this was a mistake as a reprint or repair would require total disasembily.

The nut trap was needed to connect the paralell gear ste and make sure that they where spining in unison not figting against eachother.

Overall I should have scraped most of the design but becasue I had became too invested in this design I had not scraped it.

## Reflection
This project had many diffrent issues from the begining i lacked motivation and excitemnt I usaly have for projects stifilig my creative cading abilities that usaly make great designs.
