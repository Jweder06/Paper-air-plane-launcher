# Paper Air plane launcher
This was a relatively complex project that aimed to launch a paper air plane with a geared robotic arm.
## Planing
Most of the planing was done with a google doc and MS paint and there was no schedule set out
### Here are some inital drawings

## Cad
The cad was realtivly difucult creating 1 part that could hold 3 gears and the top of the box together. Complicated and compact that would hurt the consturction process later. 
### Gears

The gears where by far the most complicated part of the design process. It included to nut traps 3 interchanging gears a 1 arm mount.

The nut trap was needed to connect the paralell gear ste and make sure that they where spining in unison not figting against eachother.
